# Sorting Visualizater
This project provides a visualization of various sorting algorithms using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The visualizer helps users understand how different sorting algorithms work by displaying the sorting process in an interactive and graphical manner.

Implemented algorithms:
1) Bubble sort
2) Selection sort
3) Insertion sort
4) Merge sort
5) Quick sort
6) Heap sort

# Features

1. Colored Representation of Steps:

Blue: Default state
Yellow: Element being compared
Red: Element identified as in incorrect position and to be moved
Green: Element in correct position

2. Controls for Visualizations:
Speed of Visualization: Five speed levels
Data Size: Adjust the size of the dataset
Generate New Data: Randomly generate new data for sorting
Displays each bar value

3.Complexity Analysis:
Display the time and space complexity of the algorithm being visualized
